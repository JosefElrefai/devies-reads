This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Assignment Notes

Some improvements that can be made to the app:

- Giving feedback for the log in and sign up pages (ex. wrong username / password)
- Adding unit / integration tests
- Improving on prettier and linting
- General cleanup and better typing

I have not worked with next 13+ before (app dir), so this assignment seved as an assignemnt and a learning opportuinty.
